================================================================
Web-Interface for Solaris-Servers to display Status-Information
================================================================

The Interface is based on minimalistic HTML5 with Java-Script (jQuery)

Formerly tested on Solaris 11 Express, now used and developed under OmniOS Stable.
It is usable under *any* Unix/Linux, only the shipped default commands are somewhat Unix/Illumos & ZFS focused.

Installation:
	see install directory
	
Configuration:
	see conf.ini.php

Feedback appreciated

Cheers,
