	tbl.header("atime", "Controls whether the access time for files is updated when they are read. Turning this property off avoids producing write traffic when reading files and can result in significant performance gains, though it might confuse mailers and similar utilities.")
	tbl.header("available", "Read-only property that identifies the amount of disk space available to a dataset and all its children, assuming no other activity in the pool. Because disk space is shared within a pool, available space can be limited by various factors including physical pool size, quotas, reservations, and other datasets within the pool.")

Because disk space is shared within a pool, available space can be limited by various factors including physical pool size, quotas, reservations, and other datasets within the pool.")
	tbl.header("canmount", "Controls whether a file system can be mounted with the zfs mount command. This property can be set on any file system, and the property itself is not inheritable. However, when this property is set to off, a mount point can be inherited to descendent file systems, but the file system itself is never mounted.")
	tbl.header("casesensitivity", "This property indicates whether the file name matching algorithm used by the file system should be casesensitive,caseinsensitive, or allow a combination of both styles of matching (mixed). Traditionally, UNIX and POSIX file systems have case-sensitive file names.")
	tbl.header("checksum", "Controls the checksum used to verify data integrity. The default value is on, which automatically selects an appropriate algorithm, currently fletcher4. The values are on, off, fletcher2, fletcher4, sha256, and sha256+mac. A value of off disables integrity checking on user data. A value of off is not recommended.")
	tbl.header("compression", "Enables or disables compression for a dataset. The values are on, off, lzjb, gzip, and gzip-N. Currently, setting this property to lzjb, gzip, or gzip-N has the same effect as setting this property to on. Enabling compression on a file system with existing data only compresses new data. Existing data remains uncompressed.")

	tbl.header("copies", "Sets the number of copies of user data per file system. Available values are 1, 2, or 3. These copies are in addition to any pool-level redundancy. Disk space used by multiple copies of user data is charged to the corresponding file and dataset, and counts against quotas and reservations. In addition, the used property is updated when multiple copies are enabled. Consider setting this property when the file system is created because changing this property on an existing file system only affects newly written data.")

	tbl.header("keysource", "Identifies the format and location of the key that wraps the dataset keys. The valid property values are raw, hex,passphrase,prompt, or file. The key must be present when the dataset is created, mounted, or loaded by using the zfs key -l command. If encryption is enabled for a new dataset, the default keysource is passphrase,prompt.")
	tbl.header("keystatus", "Read-only property that identifies the dataset's encryption key status. The availability of a dataset's key is indicated by availableor unavailable. For datasets that do not have encryption enabled, none is displayed.")
	tbl.header("logbias", "Controls how ZFS optimizes synchronous requests for this dataset. If logbias is set to latency, ZFS uses the pool's separate log devices, if any, to handle the requests at low latency. If logbias is set to throughput, ZFS does not use the pool's separate log devices. Instead, ZFS optimizes synchronous operations for global pool throughput and efficient use of resources. The default value is latency.")

If the labeled dataset matches the labeled zone, the dataset can be mounted and accessed from the labeled zone. The default value is none. This property can only be modified when Trusted Extensions is enabled and only with the appropriate privilege.")

When the mountpoint property is changed for a file system, the file system and any descendents that inherit the mount point are unmounted. If the new value is legacy, then they remain unmounted. Otherwise, they are automatically remounted in the new location if the property was previously legacy or none, or if they were mounted before the property was changed. In addition, any shared file systems are unshared and shared in the new location.")
	tbl.header("primarycache", "Controls what is cached in the primary cache (ARC). Possible values are all, none, and metadata. If set to all, both user data and metadata are cached. If set to none, neither user data nor metadata is cached. If set to metadata, only metadata is cached.")

	tbl.header("normalization", "This property indicates whether a file system should perform a unicode normalization of file names whenever two file names are compared, and which normalization algorithm should be used. File names are always stored unmodified, names are normalized as part of any comparison process. If this property is set to a legal value other than none, and the utf8only property was left unspecified, the utf8only property is automatically set to on. The default value of the normalization property is none. This property cannot be changed after the file system is created.")

	tbl.header("quota", "Limits the amount of disk space a dataset and its descendents can consume. This property enforces a hard limit on the amount of disk space used, including all space consumed by descendents, such as file systems and snapshots. Setting a quota on a descendent of a dataset that already has a quota does not override the ancestor's quota, but rather imposes an additional limit. Quotas cannot be set on volumes, as the volsize property acts as an implicit quota.")
	tbl.header("rekeydate", "Read-only property that indicates the date of the last data encryption key change from a zfs key -K or zfs clone -K operation on this dataset. If no rekey operation has been performed, the value of this property is the same as the creation date.")

When the amount of disk space used is below this value, the dataset is treated as if it were taking up the amount of space specified by refreservation. The refreservation reservation is accounted for in the parent dataset's disk space used, and counts against the parent dataset's quotas and reservations.")

Otherwise, the zfs share command is invoked with options equivalent to the contents of this property. If set tooff, the file system is managed by using the legacy share and unshare commands and the dfstab file.")

Possible values are: standard, the default value, which means synchronous file system transactions, such as fsync, O_DSYNC, O_SYNC, and so on, are written to the intent log; always, ensures that every file system transaction is written and flushed to stable storage by a returning system call. This value has a significant performance penalty; disabled, means that synchronous requests are disabled. File system transactions are only committed to stable storage on the next transaction group commit, which might be after many seconds. This value gives the best performance, with no risk of corrupting the pool. However, this value is very dangerous because ZFS is ignoring the synchronous transaction demands of applications, such as databases or NFS operations. Setting this value on the currently active root or /varfile system might result in out-of-spec behavior, application data loss, or increased vulnerability to replay attacks. You should only use this value if you fully understand all the associated risks.")
